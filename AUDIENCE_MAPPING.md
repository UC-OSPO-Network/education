## Rationale for Standardization

### Key Changes

1. **Removed ambiguous terms:**
   - "Open Source Contributors" → Mapped to "Software Developers" or "Beginners" based on context
   - "Open Science Contributors" → "Researchers" or "RSEs"
   - "Communities" → "Community Managers"
   - "Individuals, Companies" → "Maintainers, Community Managers"

2. **Consolidated overlapping roles:**
   - "Developers", "Python Developers" → "Software Developers"
   - "Software Engineers", "DevOps Engineers" → "Software Developers" (DevOps context preserved in lesson content)
   - "HPC Engineers" → "RSEs" (research-specific technical roles)

3. **Filled missing values based on lesson content:**
   - Building Community → Community-focused roles
   - Leadership and Governance → Leadership roles
   - Collaboration in Open Research Projects → Research collaboration roles
   - How to Contribute to Open Source → Entry-level contributors
   - Reproducibility Principles and Practices → Research practitioners
   - Reproducible Research for Teams with GitHub → Research teams
