## 🤔 Observations & Questions

### Unused SubTopics (3)
These subTopics have no lessons assigned:
1. **Understand Open Source Culture** - May need lessons about open source philosophy, ethics, community norms
2. **Enable Collaboration** - Distinct from "Understand Collaborative Workflows"? Or merge?
3. **Know Your Responsibilities** - Compliance/licensing responsibilities beyond fundamentals?

### Heavy Concentration
**Build Reliable Systems** has 41% of all lessons (13/32). This is expected for a maintainer-heavy pathway but may want to verify:
- Are all these truly about "building reliable systems"?
- Should some be "Sustain Your Project" instead?
- Is the distinction clear?

### Research vs. General Software
We have a good split between research-specific (**Advance Open Research**: 5 lessons) and general software development.

### Getting Started Pathway Gap
The "Getting Started with Open Source" pathway has **0 lessons** currently. Issue #26 (assigned to giaari15) is to find 5-7 lessons to fill this gap.

Expected subTopics for those would be:
- **Learn the Basics** (currently 1 lesson)
- **Understand Open Source Culture** (currently 0 lessons)

## ✏️ Notes for Tim's Review

### Changes Needed
1. **Update existing assignments**:
   - Change "Building Community" from "Collaboration" → "Grow & Support Your Community"
   - Change "Leadership and Governance" from "Governance" → "Grow & Support Your Community"

2. **Bulk assignment**: 30 lessons need subTopics assigned

### Questions for Consideration
1. Should "Build Reliable Systems" be split further (testing vs. packaging vs. infrastructure)?
2. Is "Enable Collaboration" meant to be distinct from workflows? If so, what fits there?
3. Should some research-oriented lessons about testing/packaging go to "Advance Open Research" instead of "Build Reliable Systems"?

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Tim reviews and edits** suggested assignments in this file
2. **Update Google Sheet** with approved subTopics (use staging tab method from Obsidian notes)
3. **Verify groupings** on pathway pages make logical sense
4. **Close issue #23** once complete

---

## 🔄 How to Update Google Sheet

From your Obsidian notes: Use the **staging tab method**

1. Create a STAGING tab in Google Sheets
2. Import this data (or manually enter)
3. Use XLOOKUP to pull subTopics by lesson name:
   ```
   =XLOOKUP(A2, STAGING!A:A, STAGING!B:B)
   ```
4. Review and verify
5. Delete STAGING tab
