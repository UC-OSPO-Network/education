# Data Quality Analysis (Corrected)

**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Source:** Google Sheets CSV (56 lessons analyzed)
**Status:** 26 fully valid lessons out of 56 (46%)

## ⚠️ Previous Analysis Was Wrong

**My mistake**: The previous analysis incorrectly reported 197 rows with 0 valid lessons. This was due to improper CSV parsing that split multi-line fields (like learning objectives with internal line breaks) into separate rows.

**Corrected parsing**: Now properly handles quoted fields with internal carriage returns.

## Critical Issues Summary (CORRECTED)

| Issue | Count | % of Total | Severity |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| Missing slug | 56 | 100% | 🟡 Medium (auto-generated) |
| Missing description | 29 | 52% | 🟠 High |
| Missing URL | 1 | 2% | 🔴 Critical |
| Missing educational level | ~3 | 5% | 🟢 Low |
| Missing subtopic | ~28 | 50% | 🟡 Medium |

## Good News!

Your data quality is **much better than initially reported**:

✅ **All lessons have names** (100%)
✅ **55/56 lessons have URLs** (98%)
✅ **27/56 lessons have descriptions** (48%)
✅ **Most lessons have educational levels** (95%)

## What Needs Fixing

### 1. Slugs (Already Generated) ✅
**Status**: Generated by `scripts/generate-slugs.js`
**File**: `scripts/output/slugs-2026-01-18.csv`
**Action**: Just upload the enhanced CSV

### 2. Descriptions (29 lessons)
**Examples**:
- Row 10: "Python Packaging" - no description
- Row 12: "R Packaging" - no description
- Row 14: "How to Contribute to Open Source" - no description

**Action**: Add brief descriptions for these 29 lessons

### 3. Subtopics (~28 lessons)
**Status**: Partially assigned in `scripts/output/subtopic-assignments-2026-01-19.csv`
**Action**: Review and approve the suggested subtopics

### 4. One Missing URL
**Action**: Find and add the missing URL (likely a recent addition)

## No Structural Problems!

Unlike my previous incorrect analysis, there are **NO** issues with:
- ❌ Learning objectives in separate rows (NOT A PROBLEM)
- ❌ Hierarchical structure (DOES NOT EXIST)
- ❌ Fragmented data (CSV WAS FINE)

The CSV structure is correct. Learning objectives are properly stored in multi-line fields within each lesson row.

## What's Been Enhanced

The `scripts/output/MERGED-enhanced-metadata-2026-01-20.csv` contains:

1. ✅ **Slugs**: 56/56 (100%) - Auto-generated
2. ⚠️ **Language codes**: 6/56 (11%) - Standardized
3. ⚠️ **Curated subtopics**: 32/56 (57%) - Assigned
4. ⚠️ **Dependencies**: 24/56 (43%) - Converted to slugs
5. ⚠️ **Time estimates**: 53/56 (95%) - Generated

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (5 minutes)
1. ✅ Upload `scripts/output/MERGED-enhanced-metadata-2026-01-20.csv` to Google Sheets
2. ✅ Test the site still works

### Short-term (1-2 hours)
3. Add descriptions for the 29 lessons missing them
4. Review and approve the subtopic assignments
5. Add the 1 missing URL

### Long-term (Next week)
6. Complete language standardization for remaining 50 lessons
7. Migrate to Keystatic for better data management

## Summary

**Your data quality is good!** The main gaps are:
- 100% need slugs (already generated ✅)
- 52% need descriptions (easy to add)
- 50% need subtopics (suggestions provided)

This is **much more manageable** than the 197 broken rows I incorrectly reported earlier.

**Apologies for the confusion!** The CSV parser was treating newlines inside quoted fields as row separators.
