## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git for version control
- Basic familiarity with:
  - Command line interface
  - Astro framework (helpful but not required)
  - TypeScript (for contributing to the codebase)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the project:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/education.git
    ```
2.  **Go to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd education
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running Validation Checks

The project includes automated validation scripts to ensure data quality and build integrity:

```bash
# Run TypeScript type checking
npx astro check

# Build the site
npm run build
```

These checks run automatically on pull requests via GitHub Actions.

### Run Locally

To run the project locally in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, usually at `http://localhost:4321`.

### Deployment

This project is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions:
- **Production**: Automatically deploys from the `main` branch to GitHub Pages
- **PR Previews**: Pull requests automatically generate preview deployments via Vercel

The deployment workflow runs validation checks, builds the site, and publishes to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to main.

## 📝 Usage

### Browsing Lessons

Visit the live site to explore the lesson library:
1. **Browse by Category**: Navigate through different topics and skill areas
2. **Search**: Use the search functionality to find specific lessons
3. **Filter**: Narrow results by source, duration, difficulty, or topic
4. **Learning Pathways**: Follow curated sequences of lessons

### Updating Content

### Updating Content

**1. Keystatic (Primary Source)**
- This project uses [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/) for managing rich markdown content like lessons and pathways.
- **Local Access**: When running the dev server (`npm run dev`), visit `http://localhost:4321/keystatic` to access the Admin UI.
- **GitHub Integration**: In production, content is managed directly via GitHub PRs, but you can use the local UI to generate the commits.

**2. Google Sheets (Legacy/Migration)**
- The [lesson inventory spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xl27XUuV_n5zG9_8Xq_87wTzN-P_A2W_Zz4k5_W-Q4/edit) is used as a metadata review hub and migration support surface.
- **Note**: This sheet is **NOT** automatically synced during the build and is not the canonical source of site content.
- **Preferred review/update workflow**: generate the review CSV with:
  ```bash
  npm run sheets:prepare-update
  ```
- Then follow the canonical review/apply guide in:
  ```bash
  scripts/UPDATING_GOOGLE_SHEETS.md
  ```
- **Manual re-import**: If you need to re-import from Sheets into repo content (warning: overwrites local changes), run:
  ```bash
  npm run migrate:lessons
  ```
